Creating a comprehensive README is crucial for explaining your project, its architecture, and how to get it up and running. Below is a template for a README that covers both the frontend and backend parts of the Task Manager application. You can adjust the content to fit the specifics of your project.

# Task Manager Application

This repository contains the code for both the frontend and backend parts of the Task Manager application. The application allows users to create, update, delete, and filter tasks. Each task has a title, description, and a status (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done").

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB (for the backend)

### Installing and Running the Backend

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**

    ```
    cd my-task-manager-backend
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    Run the following command to install the necessary node modules:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start MongoDB**

    Ensure MongoDB is running on your system. If you're using MongoDB Atlas, make sure to update the connection string in `src/db/mongoose.js`.

4. **Start the Server**

    ```
    npm start
    ```

    The backend server should start, typically on port 3001.

### Installing and Running the Frontend

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**

    ```
    cd my-task-manager-frontend
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    Run the following command to install the necessary node modules:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the Frontend Application**

    ```
    npm start
    ```

    The frontend should open in your default browser, typically on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Usage

- **Create a Task**: Use the form to add a new task. Fields include a title, description, and status.
- **View Tasks**: Tasks are listed with options to edit or delete.
- **Edit a Task**: Click the edit button next to any task to update its title, description, or status.
- **Delete a Task**: Click the delete button to remove a task.
- **Filter Tasks**: Use the dropdown to filter tasks by their status.

## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - The web framework used for the frontend
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - The backend server
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) - Database and object modeling for Node.js
